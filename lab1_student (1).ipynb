    "You can think of a Pandas DataFrame object as a sequence of aligned Series objects (aligned in the sense that they share the same index.) These are some ways you can construct DataFrames: from a single Series object, from a list of dictionaries, from a dictionary of Series objects, from a 2-d numpy array, from a Numpy Structured array, or by importing some data (for example, a CSV file). If you know SQL, DataFrames are designed to allow for different joins of datasets, and lots of other functionalities.\n",

The Pearson correlation coefficient (named for Karl Pearson) can be used to summarize the strength of the linear relationship between two data samples.\n",

    "The Pearson’s correlation coefficient is calculated as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of the standard deviation of each data sample. It is the normalization of the covariance between the two variables to give an interpretable score. In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient, also referred to as Pearson's r, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC), or the bivariate correlation, is a statistic that measures linear correlation between two variables X and Y. It has a value between +1 and −1. A value of +1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and −1 is total negative linear correlation.\n",
