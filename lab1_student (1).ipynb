    "\n",
    "Now we operate on the arrays:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's what happened inside the NumPy machinery:\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy aligned the shapes of a and b on the last axis and prepended 1s to the shape with fewer axes:\n",
    " a: 4 x 1     --->    a: 4 x 1\n",
    " b:     3     --->    b: 1 x 3\n",

    " a: 4 x 1  \n",
    " b: 1 x 3  \n",
    "``a`` and ``b`` satisfied this criterion.  \n",
    "NumPy stretched both arrays on their 1-valued axes so that their shapes matched, then added them together.\n",
    "``a`` was replicated 3 times in the second axis, while ``b`` was replicated 4 times in the first axis.\n",

    "Prepend 1s to the smaller shape,\n",
    "check that the axes of both arrays have sizes that are equal or 1,\n",
    "then stretch the arrays in their size-1 axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial aspect of this rule is that it does not require the input arrays have the same number of axes.\n",
    "Another consequence of it is that a broadcasting output will have the largest size of its inputs in each axis.\n",
    "Take the following multiplication as an example:\n",

    "You can think of a Pandas DataFrame object as a sequence of aligned Series objects (aligned in the sense that they share the same index.) These are some ways you can construct DataFrames: from a single Series object, from a list of dictionaries, from a dictionary of Series objects, from a 2-d numpy array, from a Numpy Structured array, or by importing some data (for example, a CSV file). If you know SQL, DataFrames are designed to allow for different joins of datasets, and lots of other functionalities.\n",

The Pearson correlation coefficient (named for Karl Pearson) can be used to summarize the strength of the linear relationship between two data samples.\n",

    "The Pearson’s correlation coefficient is calculated as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of the standard deviation of each data sample. It is the normalization of the covariance between the two variables to give an interpretable score. In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient, also referred to as Pearson's r, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC), or the bivariate correlation, is a statistic that measures linear correlation between two variables X and Y. It has a value between +1 and −1. A value of +1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and −1 is total negative linear correlation.\n",
